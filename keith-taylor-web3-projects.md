Web3 Projects
  keithtaylor
    Basically, my Web3 Google+ site
    Focus on my life, bio, etc
    Mention projects as my personal commentary on their plans and progress
    Frontend should be a new project under the Shrewdies umbrella (because it exists, so can grow like Foodary)
  GoutPal
    Earlier, I tried to do the admin and the advice. But only doctors can give advice. The rest of us should help people by describing their experiences about working with doctors.
    It's up to a (developing) community to make rules about non-doctor experiences. For now, I can insist that writers of non-doctor experiences include an appropriate disclaimer.
  Foodary
    ALKAscore might be useful as project name
    Want to move away from Foodary to something derived from Low Acid Eating
    Maybe just use ALKAscore because:
      It exists
      It emphasizes (slightly) that alkalinity is involved
      Could be an ideal bridge into a new community. I.e. my working project is ALKAscore. But I'm open to moving it into a community project
```

Emphasize organic growth. From Shrewdies projects to new brands. Of which GoutPal and ALKAscore are examples of the potential for Social Support.
